# Letter to the Evaluators

Dear evaluators,

Please do not suspect this project is done by another person, if you see two authors shuai114 and wslw77. They are actually both me. If you want to know more details, please read on.

I am retaking the JHU Coursera course "The Data Scientist¡¯s Toolbox", because I did not get the verified certificate in the previous course due to not authenticating myself by mistake (the quizzes for this course are not required to authenticate, so I did not do it, but I did not know I would end up not getting the verified ceritificate). Now I don't know if I can use the past project again, so I signed up for a new account and did it again.

My previous git account username is shuai114, and my new git account username is wslw77. If you see those two authors, they are actually both me. Thank you very much in advance!

Yours sincerely,
Shuai Wang
